                <h2 class="text-center text-secondary">conclusion</h2>
                <p>Rhino is the second largest momel in the world.
                    The rhinoceros is an animal that is essential for maintaining ecological balance.
                    The rhino as an iconic, rare, and exotic species garners attention from the public, much to its
                    glory and its downfall.
                    And, as a keystone species for tourism sites across Africa, it creates opportunities for historical
                    interactions and for the improvement of economic and social environments of local communities.
                    Rhinos have survived for over 50 million years, but the barrage of the modern human may prove too
                    much for this prehistoric megafauna.
                    It will require all the creativity and perseverance of the scientific and conservation communities
                    to protect the remaining populations and help them survive into the next era for future generations
                    to experience.
                </p>
                <p class>It is unfortunate that Rhino is on the verge of extinction. It is everyone's duty to raise
                    awareness globally to prevent extinction.
                    The threats to Rohino are how it will be destroyed. We will also talked about how technology can be
                    used to prevent it from becoming extinct.
                    Efforts should be made to store the genes of the present rhinoceros population and thereby produce
                    rhinos.
                    in cyper physical system we are used gps tracking, geofenching movement and no movement alert
                    technoligies
                    with technologies we can watch their activities every time.Not only do we have to create habitats
                    for it, we have to provide the food and medicines we need for it and guess how to maintain it.
                    New laws should be introduced to provide penalties for those who provide these animals
                    our biggest social responsibility is "This species should be multiplied and passed on to the next
                    generation people" </p>
