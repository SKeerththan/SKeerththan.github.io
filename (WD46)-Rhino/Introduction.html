                    <p class="text-left">
                        Endangered species, any species that is at risk of extinction because of a
                        sudden rapid decrease in its population or a loss of its critical habitat.
                        Previously, any species of plant or animal that was threatened with
                        extinction could be called an endangered species. The need for separate
                        definitions of "endangered" and "threatened" species resulted in the
                        development of various categorization systems, each containing
                        definitions and criteria by which a species can be classified
                        according to its risk of extinction. As a rule, a range of criteria must be analyzed before a
                        species can be placed in one category or another
                    </p>
                    <p>According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species,
                        over 26,500 species are in danger of extinction. This includes 40 percent of amphibians, 34 percent
                        of conifers, 33 percent of reef-building corals, 25 percent of mammals and 14 percent of birds. In
                        the U.S., over 1,600 species are listed as threatened or endangered.</p>

                        extinction risk of a given species. In general, these criteria consider:</p>

                        <li>The rate of population decline</li>

                        <li>Whether the species already possesses a small population size</li>
                        <li>Whether the species is very small or lives in a restricted area</li>
                        <li>Whether the results of a quantitative analysis indicates a high probability of extinction in the
                            wild

                    <p>In 1997 black  rhinos populations was at 65000
                        but only 2,400 black rhinos remained, leaving the species on the brink of extinction  
                         Rhino population losses of over 60,000 black rhinos in only 20 years
                        Since 2013 an average of three rhinos have been poached every day.
                        More and more birds and animals need to be protected from extinction so Me and my team
                        chose Rhino because we wanted to raise awareness and protect this Rhino from destruction.</p>

                        <p>The biggest threat to the rhino is the very small size of the remaining populations. This leads
                            to
                            inbreeding and loss of genetic variability and vitality. The two habitats where Javan rhinos
                            occur
                            are secure, but much too small for long-term survival of the species.</p>
                        <p class="h3">why are rhinos so important to the environment?</p>
                        <p>Rhinos are environmental engineers in the areas where they live. For example, water-accessible
                            meadow habitats are important for high-horned rhinos, and they help maintain the health of these
                            meadows and the water bodies they wall, which enables them to adapt to other small plant species
                            that share space with them. Asian rhinos scatter the seeds of plants and the fruits they eat
                            through their dung.</p>

                        <p>There are only 68 jawan rhinos left on the planet, all of which live on only one site:
                            Indonesia's Ujung Kulon National Park.
                            Rhinos can be considered one of the most exotic animals in the world,
                            But few know that they are found in Africa and Asia
                            There are actually five different species: white rhinoceros,
                            Black Rhinoceros, Greater One Horn (or Indian) Rhinoceros, Sumatran Rhinoceros
                            And the Javan (or at least one horned) rhino. The white rhinoceros, black rhinoceros,
                            And the Greater One Horn Rhinoceros have all undergone impressive retrievals
                            In the twentieth century due to integrated security efforts.
                            These species continue to struggle with the ever-present threat
                            It is unfortunate that white rhinoceros hunts
                            The decline in the number of repeats in recent years. However, the predicament
                            These three species do not compare the two
                            Restricted species in Indonesia; Sumatran Rhinoceros and Javan
                            The rhino faces a grim future without major intervention
    
    
                            With a broad head, powerful legs and deep folds of skin like armor,
                            The Javan Rhinoceros stands over five feet high on the shoulder and weighs
                            Almost two tons. It is the second largest terrestrial animal
                            Indonesia (after the Asian elephant).</p>
