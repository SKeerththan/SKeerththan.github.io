                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout Eurasia and Africa once rhinos were found. But today
                            3/5 Rhino species are condemnatory which means they are facing the edge of destruction.
                            In the past nearly years, they have dropped drastically because of poaching for their horn.
                            Which has a huge demand in the market of Asian countries.
                            They also face threats from habitat loss and political conflict. Will look this out briefly.

                                        Therefore, it have been targeted heavily by the poachers.
                                        The value of the horns is continuously increasing because of the lack of rhinos

                                        But after 2017 the ban took place after the legal battle to overturn it.

                    <p>In traditional Chinese medicine, people use rhino horns. Apart from that people used to have that
                        as a status symbol of victory and wealth.
                        For all rhino range states, hunting became a threat.
                        Africa is called the world of rhinos because the majority of rhinos are there. Therefore, it
                        have been targeted heavily by the poachers.
                        The value of the horns is continuously increasing because of the lack of rhinos availability.

                        for the purpose of treat fever, rheumatism, gout, and other disorders.
                        Some people also gave it to terminally ill relatives to console them and show that

                    <p>In international trade since 1977 under CITES, the rhinos’ horn was banned. ​In South Africa,
                        it’s still possible to trade rhino horns within the country domestically.
                        But after 2017 the ban took place after the legal battle to overturn it.
                        There are a lot of calls from within the country to legalize the international trade in rhino

                        constantly increasing. Which is a huge threat to all the species as wildlife that need space to
                        survive and thrive.
                        And this also considered as a huge limitation to enabling the number of rhinos to recover and
                        increase.

                        Most of the countries lost their rhino population because of habitat loss.
