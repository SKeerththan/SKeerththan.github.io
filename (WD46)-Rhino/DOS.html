                    <h>
                        <p>Poaching has been a persistent problem plaguing the animal kingdom since ages. While the dead
                            wild
                            animals were treated as trophies by the royal families earlier, in current times, they have
                            become
                            targets of greed.</p>
    
                        <p>The incessant incidents of poaching of wild animals have led to large decline in iconic mammals
                            such as
                            elephants, rhinos, zebras, and gorillas.</p>
    
                        <p>Governments world over are continuously struggling with this menace. The forest departments have
                            tried
                            cameras and sensors but without much success. With the rural population involved in the crime,
                            it
                            becomes all the more difficult to track the poachers and save the animals.</p>
    
                        <p>Countries like India and Africa are rich in biodiversity and consequently face the brunt of
                            poaching
                            greatly. One horn rhinos are a popular target for poachers.</p>
    
                        <p>According to <a href="https://www.traffic.org/">TRAFFIC</a>, the wildlife trade monitoring
                            organization,
                            South Africa is home to about 80 percent of the world’s 29,000 rhinos.</p>
    
                        <p>Though 2019 is the third year in a row the number of rhinos poached in South Africa has
                            dropped—from a
                            high of 1,215 in 2014—African rhinos remain under severe threat from poaching and habitat
                            destruction.
    
                            For these reasons, very few African rhinos now survive outside of protected areas and
                            sanctuaries.
    
                            Organized poaching groups are also using increasingly sophisticated methods to locate and track
                            rhinos,
                            including helicopters, night vision equipment, and powerful veterinary drugs.</p>
                        <br>
    
                        <h3>GPS tracking to rescue</h3>
                        <p> In addition to reducing demand for rhino horns, conservationists are implementing proactive and
                            preventative anti-poaching technologies to protect rhino populations across Africa.
    
                            GPS Tracking is enabling conservationists to track the movements and location of the animals.
                            This help
                            in rescuing injured or orphaned rhinos due to poaching.
    
                            However, wildlife tracking requires a robust, flexible and most importantly, reliable
                            battery-powered
                            GPS tracking solution to provide anti-poaching units and farm managers with more than just
                            life-saving
                            location tracking.

                                <P>In partnership with <a href="http://www.rhino911.com/"> Rhino 911</a>, a not-for-profit
                                    organization
                                    providing helicopter rescue to injured or orphaned rhinos due to poaching and other
                                    injuries, <a href="https://tgtracking.co.za/tracking-devices/">TG Tracking</a> is using
                                    the <a href="https://www.digitalmatter.com/devices/oyster2/"> Oyster2 </a>
                                    battery-powered GPS and
                                    Telematics Guru to help prevent poaching in South Africa.
    
                                    With industry-leading battery life, a high-precision GPS/GLONASS positioning system,
                                    built-in
                                    battery-life management, and a 3-Axis accelerometer, TG Tracking began trialling the
                                    Digital Matter
                                    Oyster device in 2017.
    
                                    Designed for location tracking, behavior monitoring, theft recovery, and more, the
                                    Oyster2 is installed
                                    or concealed on, or in, all sorts of assets – mainly industrial ones, like vehicles,
                                    trailers,
                                    containers, and more.
    
                                    But when it comes to tracking rhinos, well, things get a bit more complicated </p>
    
                            </div>

                        </div>
                        <h3>Safely securing a GPS device to a rhino</h3>
                        <p> Fitted around the Oyster2, TG Tracking developed a custom collar, enhancing the device’s
                            battery-life,
                            temperature tolerance, and ensuring maximum comfort for the animals.
    
                            TG Tracking’s unique resin potting houses the Oyster2 and a custom SAFT D-Cell battery-pack,
                            which
                            enables longer battery-life and extreme temperature tolerance.
    
                            TG Tracking’s unique 3-layer structure and light-weight internal webbing ensures sufficient
                            strength and
                            durability, and the collar’s soft, rolled edges also protect the animals from irritation.
    
                            Prior to fitting animals with the custom collars, the Osyter2 is provisioned using a Device
                            Management
                            platform, where the frequency of location updates, geofences, accelerometer settings, and other
                            tracking
                            parameters are carefully set.
    
                            In order to protect both farm managers and the animals themselves, the rhinos are first sedated
                            from
                            helicopters and safely guided to a clear, unobstructed area.
    
                            Collars are attached to the rhino’s front legs.
    
                            The time of collaring, veterinary information, and more information on the animal is captured
                            and saved
                            in Telematics Guru. The rhinos are then closely monitored as they regain movement.</p>
                        <h3> Location Tracking</h3>
    
                        <p> Anti-poaching units monitor the rhino’s locations 24 hours a day. Location data captured by the
                            Oyster2
                            is also used to understand daily routes and distance travelled, areas of grazing, and other
                            general
                            behavioural patterns to ensure high-traffic areas are always protected.</p>
    
                        <h3> Geofencing</h3>
                        <p> Geofencing works alongside location tracking by creating a virtual boundary around specific
                            areas of the
                            park. If animals move beyond these boundaries, units are immediately alerted.
    
                            Geo-fence downloads and alerting allow the farmers to be informed if the Rhino has moved out of
                            its
                            usual behavioural locations – possibly due to poaching.</p>
    
                        <h3> Movement and No-Movement Alerts</h3>
    
                        <p> The Oyster’s 3-Axis Accelerometer enables smart movement-based tracking features. If the rhino
                            reaches a
                            certain speed for a set amount of time, a “running alert” is triggered, alerting units of a
                            possible
                            disturbance on the grounds.
    
                            Immobility, or “rhino down” alerts are also configured and immediately triggered if the animal
                            stops
                            moving for a configurable amount of time</p>
                    </h>
