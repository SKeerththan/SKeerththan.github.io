					<p>Shocking statistics just released from South Africa National Parks show that 341 rhinos have been
						killed by poachers in South Africa so far in 2011, compared to 333 last year, which was the
						highest total ever experienced in South Africa. Of the five species of rhinoceros, three are
						critically endangered. With the loss of the Vietnamese Javan rhino and Africa's western black
						rhino we have to do everything we can to protect the other rhino species.</p>

									<h2>A Ray of Hope</h2>
								</justify>
								<p>Not all rhino news out of South Africa is dire. In October 2011, WWF helped to
									successfully establish a new black rhino population in a safer, more spacious
									location. This work was done by the Black Rhino Range Expansion Project (BRREP), a
									partnership between WWF-South Africa, Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife and Eastern Cape Parks
									and Tourism.

									Nineteen critically endangered black rhinos were moved in order to help increase
									land available for their conservation. This reduces pressure on existing wildlife
									reserves and provides new territory where rhinos have a greater opportunity to
									increase in number. Creating more dispersed and better protected populations also
									helps keep rhinos safe from poachers.</p>

									<h2>How WWF Will Help</h2>
								</justify>
								<p>WWF has been involved in rhino conservation for nearly 50 years. Our efforts in both
									Asia and Africa work to save the rhino population in multiple ways:</p>
								<ol>

									<li>Expand existing protected areas and improving their management as well as
										establishing new protected areas
									</li>
									<li>Improve security monitoring to protect rhinos from poaching</li>
									<li>Improve local and international law enforcement to stop the flow of rhino horn
										and other illegal wildlife trade items from Africa to other regions of the world
									</li>
									<li>Promote well managed wildlife-based tourism experiences that will also provide
										additional funding for conservation efforts</li>

										<h5>Hardwares</h5>
										<p> PLP is committed to protecting wildlife by working with utility companies to
											design and manufacture wildlife protection products that aid in reducing
											wildlife mortalities from interaction with electric power distribution
											lines, structures, and equipment. Additionally, these products reduce
											customer outages, the resulting revenue losses, and potential regulatory
											fines on utility companies. PLP also produces similar wildlife protection
											products for use in electric power transmission systems.</p>

										<p>The main purpose of motion detection is to sense an intruder and send an
											alert to your control panel, which alerts your monitoring center. The
											interior motion detector is an essential element of your security system,
											because it’s the main device that detects when someone or animal is in the
											forset when they shouldn’t be. A motion sensor uses smart technology to
											detect movement in an area. If a sensor is tripped, a signal is sent to your
											security system’s control panel, which connects to your monitoring center,
											alerting you and the monitoring center to a potential threat in your
											manitain room.</p>

										<p>The killing of the animal in a national park in Zimbabwe by a big-game hunter
											has sparked worldwide outrage. Researchers at the University of Oxford had
											outfitted Cecil with a GPS collar to monitor his behaviour. It was only
											thanks to this special tag that the cause of the animal's death was cleared
											up. At the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology in Radolfzell, scientists
											also use transmitters to observe the behavior of different species of
											animals. The data collected through telemetry is so accurate that it can
											help to quickly locate killed animals and clear up their cause of death.
